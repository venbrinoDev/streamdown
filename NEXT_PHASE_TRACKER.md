# streamdown — Next Phase Tracker

Living document for tracking execution of [`NEXT_PHASE.md`](NEXT_PHASE.md).

**Update cadence:** End of every working session, or after the `streamdown-growth-executor` agent completes a phase.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-26 (v0.1.0 shipped + agent-side autonomous tasks complete; awaiting user actions)

**Companion docs:** [`NEXT_PHASE.md`](NEXT_PHASE.md) = the plan · [`PUBLISH.md`](PUBLISH.md) = v0.1 launch (done) · [`TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md) = v0.1 build (done)

#### 📋 Submission package (ready to copy-paste)

**Fork target:** https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter

**File to edit:** `README.md` — find the `### Markdown` section under "Tools and Utilities → Helpers" (search for `flutter_markdown` to locate it).

**Entry to add** (alphabetically — place after `markdown_widget`):

```markdown
* [streamdown](https://github.com/jayu1023/streamdown) - Flicker-free streaming markdown renderer for Flutter AI apps. 188× faster than `flutter_markdown` on chunked input. Drop-in API for ChatGPT-style streaming UIs.
```

**PR title:**

```
Add streamdown — streaming markdown renderer for Flutter AI apps
```

**PR body:**

```
Hi! Adding a new entry under **Markdown**:

**streamdown** — a flicker-free streaming markdown renderer purpose-built for Flutter AI chat apps. It replaces `flutter_markdown`'s "re-parse every chunk" approach with an append-only AST + stable widget keys, so closed blocks never re-render mid-stream.

**After-submit checklist:**
- [ ] Star the repo (basic respect)
- [ ] Watch the PR for maintainer feedback — reply within 24h
- [ ] If rejected → fall back to: `mhadaily/awesome-flutter-cn`, `nisrulz/flutter-examples`, `iampawan/FlutterExampleApps`

### Phase B2 — Live demo site

- **Status:** 🟡 1/7 — built locally, awaiting hosting decision
- **Owner:** Agent
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Agent: ran `flutter build web --release --base-href "/streamdown/"` on example app → output at `example/build/web/` (✅ green build)
  - [ ] **User decision:** GH Pages (free, URL `jayu1023.github.io/streamdown`) OR `streamdown.dev` ($12/yr custom domain)?
  - [ ] Agent: configure deployment (GH Pages branch push, or Vercel link)
  - [ ] Agent: add bundled sample LLM responses (no API key needed)
  - [ ] Agent: wire copy-install-line button + share intent URLs
  - [ ] Agent: add Plausible/Umami snippet (only if user provides domain)
  - [ ] Agent: update README, pub.dev `homepage`, Twitter bio with demo URL
- **DoD:** URL loads in <2s; demo runs without backend; shareable
- **To deploy GH Pages now (fastest path):**
  ```bash
  cd example/build/web
  git init && git checkout -b gh-pages
  git add . && git commit -m "Deploy streamdown demo"
  git remote add origin https://github.com/jayu1023/streamdown.git
  git push -f origin gh-pages
  # Then: GitHub repo settings → Pages → source: gh-pages branch → /root
  ```

**2. Flutter Digest (submit at flutterdigest.substack.com or DM curator)**

Subject: `Package submission: streamdown — streaming markdown for Flutter AI apps`

```
Hi,

Just shipped streamdown 0.1.0 on pub.dev — a streaming markdown renderer
built for Flutter AI chat apps. Think drop-in replacement for
flutter_markdown, but with no flicker on partial code fences, tables, or
LaTeX. ~188× faster than naive re-parse on chunked input.

Drop-in API:
    Streamdown(stream: openai.responseStream)

Would love to be included in an upcoming issue if it fits.

**3. Flutter Insider (submit form / DM)**

Same body as Flutter Digest. Subject:
```
streamdown 0.1.0 — flicker-free streaming markdown for AI chat apps
```

**4. r/Flutter post (NOT r/FlutterDev — different sub, fresh audience)**

**Title:**
```
Engineering writeup: how I made markdown rendering 188× faster for Flutter streaming AI apps
```

**Body:**
```
Cross-posting the engineering side of a package I shipped last week
(originally r/FlutterDev got the launch announcement — this one's a
deeper dive on the technique).

The problem: flutter_markdown re-parses the entire response on every
streamed token. For a 2000-token GPT reply that's ~400 full re-parses +
re-highlight passes. You see it as flicker, jumping cursors, and code
blocks flashing unstyled → styled.

The fix is three tricks stacked:

1. **Incremental tokenizer** — new tokens extend the trailing AST node;
   the prefix is never re-scanned.
2. **Provisional rendering** — an unclosed ```dart fence renders as a
   code block *immediately*, then fills in as lines stream. No flash.
3. **Diff-stable widget keys** — every AST node gets a monotonic ID used
   as the Flutter widget key. Flutter's element diff doesn't tear down
   what's already on screen.

Result: 188× faster than naive re-parse on 5KB markdown with 4-char
chunks (roughly OpenAI's stream cadence). 100KB stream parses end-to-end
in under 10ms.

Source + benchmark code:
https://github.com/jayu1023/streamdown
https://pub.dev/packages/streamdown

Happy to dig into any of the three tricks if anyone's curious.
```

**5. Flutter Discord `#showcase` channel**

```
Just shipped **streamdown 0.1.0** — a flicker-free streaming markdown
renderer for Flutter AI chat apps 📦

It's a drop-in replacement for `flutter_markdown` that doesn't re-parse
on every chunk. ~188× faster on chunked input. Closed blocks never
re-render mid-stream.

```dart
Streamdown(stream: openai.responseStream)
```

That's the entire API for the common case. Theme, syntax highlighting,
link tap, and selectable text Just Work.

📦 pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/streamdown
🐙 source: https://github.com/jayu1023/streamdown

Feedback welcome — especially edge cases I haven't hit yet 🙏
```

## How to run the agent

```
> Use the streamdown-growth-executor agent to start the next phase.
```

The agent will:
1. Read this tracker → identify the next ⚪ Not-started phase by priority
2. Confirm scope with you before any destructive action (publish, push, PR)
3. Execute the phase's agent-owned tasks
4. Update this tracker (status, session log, DoD checklist)
5. Stop after one phase — you decide whether to run the next

See [`.claude/agents/streamdown-growth-executor.md`](.claude/agents/streamdown-growth-executor.md) for the full agent definition.

## Day-60 review checkpoint

Set a calendar reminder for **2026-07-25** (60 days after v0.1.0). On that date, check this against `NEXT_PHASE.md` kill criteria:

- Likes ≥ 50? __
- Weekly downloads ≥ 300? __
- Reverse dependents ≥ 1? __

If any are NO across the board → write `POSTMORTEM.md`, pivot effort to `paywall_kit`.
