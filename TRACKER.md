| Strict lint config in `analysis_options.yaml` | 🟢 | strict-casts, strict-inference, single-quotes, trailing-commas |
| Replace placeholder `Calculator` in `lib/streamdown.dart` | 🟢 | Library doc only — Phase 1+ adds real exports |
| Create target folder structure | 🟢 | `lib/src/{parser,render,theme}/`, `example/screenshots/`, `test/golden/` |
| First commit | 🟢 | `ad9310f chore: scaffold streamdown v0.0.1` |

**Phase 0 verification (DoD):**
- ✅ `flutter analyze` → 0 issues
- ✅ `flutter test` → 1 placeholder test passes
- ✅ Folder structure matches CLAUDE.md target layout
- ✅ Initial commit on `main`
- ✅ All deps resolve cleanly via `flutter pub get`

**Notes:**
- Git repo initialized inside `streamdown/` (separate from parent project folder)
- Identity used for commit: `jayu <hello@uplers.com>` (set via ephemeral `git -c`, not global config)
- TODO before publish: create actual GitHub repo at `https://github.com/jayu/streamdown` (currently a placeholder in pubspec)

## Decision log

Record any non-obvious decision here so future-you (or future-Claude) doesn't re-litigate it.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-22 | Build streamdown 1st, paywall_kit 2nd | streamdown solves universal AI-app pain, smaller scope, open lane, no existing dominant competitor on pub.dev |
| 2026-05-22 | Append-style chunk stream (not cumulative) as default API | Matches OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini SDK conventions; cumulative would force O(n²) re-parse |
| 2026-05-22 | LaTeX behind a flag, not always-on | Keeps base bundle <50KB; most chat apps don't need math |
| 2026-05-22 | BSD-3-Clause license | Matches Flutter ecosystem default; less friction for adoption |
| 2026-05-22 | `flutter_highlight` for syntax highlighting (not roll our own) | Mature, 200+ langs, low maintenance burden |
| 2026-05-22 | Two-class tokenizer split: block tokenizer is incremental (line-based, append-only), inline tokenizer is pure/non-incremental | Block tokenization needs to handle stream boundaries; inline tokenization runs on short paragraph text and is fast enough to re-run from scratch on each chunk |
| 2026-05-22 | Emphasis/strong/strike emitted as raw delimiter tokens (`StrongDelimToken`, `EmphasisDelimToken`, `StrikeDelimToken`); parser pairs them | Avoids re-implementing CommonMark's "process emphasis" algorithm twice; pairing requires context only the parser has |
| 2026-05-22 | v0.1 ships single-level blockquotes only (nested `>>` flattened to depth=1 in AST) | Real-world AI markdown rarely nests blockquotes; tokenizer captures depth so nested support can be added in v0.2 without breaking changes |
| 2026-05-22 | Lists close on any blank line (no CommonMark loose-list distinction) | Predictable behavior, easy to mentally model; AI markdown uses blank lines liberally between blocks |
| 2026-05-22 | `parser.complete()` finalizes paragraphs/lists/tables/quotes but leaves unclosed code blocks `isComplete: false` | The OPEN state is a useful signal to the renderer that the stream ended mid-block (network error, mid-token) — distinct from "stream ended at a natural boundary" |
| 2026-05-22 | Stack-based strong/em/strike pairing (counter toggle) instead of CommonMark's "process emphasis" algorithm | Pathological cases like `*foo**bar*baz**` aren't spec-compliant, but real-world AI markdown always nests delimiters well; the simpler algorithm is ~30 LOC vs ~150 for full spec; spec compliance is a v0.2 upgrade |
| 2026-05-22 | `SelectionArea` (Flutter 3.7+) at top level instead of `SelectableText.rich` per paragraph | One SelectionArea selects across blocks naturally; no per-element wrapping; cleaner widget tree; works with Text.rich children automatically |
| 2026-05-22 | `AstRenderer` is a `StatefulWidget` so it can own and dispose `GestureRecognizer`s created for link taps | TapGestureRecognizers attached to TextSpans leak if not disposed; central ownership in renderer state is the simplest correct lifecycle |
| 2026-05-22 | Block widget keys are `ValueKey(node.id)` derived from the parser's monotonic IDs | Closed nodes never get reassigned IDs, so Flutter's element diff preserves the same widget instances across stream feeds — no flicker, no rebuild |
| 2026-05-22 | `flutter_highlight`'s `HighlightView` re-parses on every rebuild; we accept this for v0.1 because widget keys mean only the OPEN block re-parses during streaming | Per-line span caching is a Phase 8 optimization. For typical AI responses (~50 lines per code block, ~5ms per parse), the closed-block stability of the widget tree keeps real-world cost bounded |
| 2026-05-22 | Fall back to plain `Text` (no highlighting) when fence has no info string | `HighlightView` throws `ArgumentError` on null language; plain Text avoids a crash and preserves the user's content intent (no language → no guesswork) |
| 2026-05-22 | Table columns use `IntrinsicColumnWidth` (grows but never shrinks) — accepting some width-growth during stream rather than computing & caching max widths | Width-growth is monotonic on streams (rows only get added, never removed), so columns only widen — no visible shrink-and-grow jitter. Caching max widths would add bookkeeping for marginal stability gain |

## Velocity / time log

| Date | Phase | Hours worked | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-22 | 0 | 1.5 | Phase 0 complete: scaffold + 4 planning docs + deps + lints + folder structure + first commit. Analyze clean, test green. |
| 2026-05-22 | 1 | 1.0 | Phase 1 complete: Token sealed hierarchy (16 token types), incremental block Tokenizer (line-based state machine, fence-aware), InlineTokenizer (delimiters + code spans + links/images + autolinks + hard breaks). 101 tests passing — chunked-vs-whole equivalence verified across 10 samples × 3 chunk sizes + append-only invariant + perf benchmark. |
| 2026-05-22 | 2 | 1.0 | Phase 2 complete: AstNode sealed hierarchy (9 node types with monotonic IDs), Parser (token → AST with trailing-path-only mutation, table promotion via separator lookahead, list/blockquote state). 166 tests passing — snapshot tests for every block type + chunked-vs-whole AST equivalence across 10 samples × 3 chunk sizes + ID monotonicity + immutability of closed nodes. `complete()` preserves unclosed code blocks as OPEN signal. |
| 2026-05-22 | 3 | 1.5 | Phase 3 complete: public `Streamdown` widget (stream + .text() constructors), `AstRenderer` (StatefulWidget owning GestureRecognizer lifecycle), inline span builder with stack-based strong/em/strike pairing, block widgets for headings/paragraphs/blockquotes/HR/lists/code/tables. 187 tests passing — every block type rendered + inline formatting + link tap recognizer + SelectionArea + element-persistence across chunk feeds (no key churn). Code blocks render plainly; Phase 4 will add syntax highlighting. Tables render basic GFM; Phase 5 will add alignment + provisional rows. |
| 2026-05-22 | 4 | 1.0 | Phase 4 complete: `SyntaxTheme` (light/dark/auto), `CodeBlockWidget` (HighlightView under the hood, language label, top-right copy-to-clipboard button with 2s cooldown, horizontal scroll for long lines), `codeBlockBuilder` full-override hook on Streamdown. Fallback to plain Text when language is null (HighlightView crashes on null lang). 199 tests passing — including custom-builder invocation, clipboard mock verification, dark/light theme rendering, and code-block element persistence across multiple chunk feeds. |
| 2026-05-22 | 5 | 0.5 | Phase 5 complete: dedicated `TableWidget` extracted to `lib/src/render/table.dart`. Cell alignment from GFM `:--`/`:--:`/`--:` markers applied via TextAlign on cell Text.rich. Inline markdown supported inside cells (bold/italic/strike/code/link/autolink) via `buildInlineSpans`. Header row gets bold styling + theme `surfaceContainerHighest` background. Wide tables wrap in horizontal SingleChildScrollView. 207 tests passing — alignment verification, inline-in-cells (bold/code/link tap), horizontal scroll, and table element persistence across row-append chunks. |
